### Description:

A simple yet challenging project, to forecast the IMF commodity price of Zinc, based on monthly totals zinc price recorded from 1980 to 2016.
Can you overcome these obstacles & Forecast the it's future prices?

**This data frame contains the following columns:**

* Month : The month of observation
* Price : Average Prices of zinc in that particular month

**Source:**

This dataset is taken from an inbuilt dataset of R called IMF-commodity-zinc.<br>

### Objectives:
- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
- Perform the necessary checks like stationarity & DF on the Dataset.
- Build a forcasting model to forecast Zinc prices.

### The Project is divided into the following steps:
1. Visualize the time series - Check for trend, seasonality, or random patterns.
2. Stationarize the series using decomposition or differencing techniques.
3. Plot ACF/PACF and find (p,d,q) parameters.
4. Building the forecasting model - can be AR, MA, ARMA or ARIMA.
5. Making Predictions using the Forecasting Model

### Some Visuals of the Project:

**1. Time-Series Data**

### Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:
- The Zinc Price Time-Series Dataset was quiet small, with just 434 samples.
- It was clear from the visuals that the time-series dataset had an upward trend & some seasonality.
- The same was confirmed with help of visual (rolling mean & std) & statistical (Dicky-Fuller Test) stionarity checks.
- The time-series was subject to Decomposition in order to stationarize the outputs.
- Futher ACF & PACF curves were plotted to extract the values of p & q, as it is required for the ARIMA Model.
- The Forecasting Model was then built with the time-series data, by feeding the optimal p,q,d values.
- Finally, the model was used to forecast the time-series of the zinc prices, into the future.
